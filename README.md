# PivotalCleaningService
Bringing Skilled workers and Employees together.

Pivotal cleaning services is an online application that acts as an employment agency for low skilled jobs such as commercial and domestic cleaners. 
Job seekers will create a profile, insert and upload their personal details, location and CV. Employers will be able to search the list of job seekers and contact them via the application if they like their profile. This is similar to the model of reed.com or indeed.com.
